# Wemos sketches collection

Some useful Wemos **D1 Mini Pro** sketches collection made with Arduino IDE.

Almost of them are suitables for the ESP866 chip too...

## Shields

* `dht22`: example sketch for the DHT22 sensor shield

## Wifi

* `mac` : shows the ESP8266 mac in the serial monitor
* `webserver`: very simple webserver made with the ESP8266
* `ap_sta_sequence`: start your ESP8266 into STA mode, and if timeout error, then starts the AP mode
